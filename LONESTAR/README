This is the top-level README for the LoneStarGPU benchmarks we ported into our HeteroSync++ framework as part of this work.
Each of the benchmarks (apps/bfs/, apps/pr, apps/sssp) have application-specific READMEs detailing how to run the applications for the various configurations.

To run all benchmarks, you can use the overall run.sh script -- this script will run BFS, PageRank (PR), and SSSP based on the commands in the application-specific READMEs.
To run this script, simply type "./run.sh" on the command line.
This script assumes you have an NVIDIA GPU attached to the system you are running this command on, and it has been tested on Pascal- and Volta-class GPUs, although similar concepts should be possible for other NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., by changing an application's compile.sh script to compile for the appropriate generation of NVIDIA GPU).
As with the top-level README, this script assumes you have added whatever directory nvcc is in on your system to your PATH in your bashrc/cshrc.
